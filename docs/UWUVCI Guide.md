# Creating the game.

1. Choose a base game (e.g., Mario Kart DS, Super Mario 64).
2. Select the ROM path for the chosen base game (locate your legally dumped ROM and select it).
3. (For GameCube only) If there are multiple disc's, ensure to select the appropriate one.
4. Provide the `otp.bin` file from your Wii U NAND dump by clicking `Enter CKey`.
5. For the `TKey` (encryption keys), you will need to obtain them yourself as we can not provide them due to legal reasons. Enter the keys and proceed.
6. Once both the CKey and TKey are entered, you can download the base game.
7. (For Wii only) The `Wii U ANCAST KEY` and the `otp.bin` file will be required again.
8. Choose `WUP Installable`, and after the download is complete, place the downloaded folder into the `install` folder on the Wii U SD card.
9. That's it! Enjoy playing your VC injects!
